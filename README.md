## General Approach
Our general approach was to combine our passions and interests as a team to a fun, social media-based app that revolves around our treasured pets. This would allow users to upload pictures of their pets (among other CRUD functionalities) to share with other users. 

Additionally, there would be an opportunity for users to add profiles for their own pets to provide more details should other users want to know more about a pet's name, species, breed, and so forth. 

The main idea is to implement both a social and personal element to the app. Beyond user and pet profiles, users would have the ability to generate journal entries for their pet's day-to-day and log in milestones for those big pet moments.

## Major Hurdles & Unsolved Problems 
At first, we had challenges with the slight learning curve of overall github management. 

Once we tackled that and got more skilled and familiar, the biggest hurdles were time, scope creep (using redux and related middlewares), and external events. If given more time, we would work to refactor our code without redux to make our app much less complicated.
